This is my third update to my original post on [predicting the NBA playoffs
with an algorithm.](http://viksalgorithms.blogspot.com/2012/05/predicting-nba-
finals-with-r.html) Here are updates
[1](http://viksalgorithms.blogspot.com/2012/06/predicting-nba-playoff-games-
results.html) and [2](http://viksalgorithms.blogspot.com/2012/06/nba-playoff-
predictions-update-2-and.html).  
  
The algorithm correctly predicted a Boston win, but missed on the
Spurs/Thunder game, so it is currently **4-2**. Haven't had any time to update
yet, so I will only be able to give you predictions for the next games,
