This is the sixth post in my series on [predicting the NBA
playoffs](http://viksalgorithms.blogspot.com/2012/05/predicting-nba-finals-
with-r.html) with an algorithm. After the Boston loss in their last game, the
algorithm is now 5-4 in the playoffs. Hopefully it is correct tonight!  
  
**Open Sourcing the Code**  
  
I have had a couple of requests to open source the code, which I had planned
to do at the end of this series of posts. However, there is one stumbling
block in that the data I am scraping cannot be redistributed (I think). If
anyone has access to box score data for the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 seasons
that has a public license, please let me know. You can contact me via the
email in my profile, or in the comments section.  
  
Being able to get the data would simplify things a lot, but I would still have
to clean up and comment the code a bit. Expect to see it out in a week or so.  
  
**Predictions**  
  
The algorithm likes Miami tonight: ![](https://vik-affirm-assets.s3-us-
