I'm currently a data scientist/general software person working in Somerville, MA.  If you're around Boston and want to get a beer, let me know!  I love meeting cool people and hacking on interesting projects.  You can find me on [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/vikparuchuri), or email me at vik dot paruchuri at gmail dot com.
