I didn't have a lot of friends growing up.  This was a source of profound shame to me in my younger years.  I developed elaborate strategies to try to mask the deficit.  I remember aimlessly wandering the halls of my school during lunch so I wouldn't have to sit by myself in the cafeteria.  I remember not really knowing how to act at parties.  In retrospect, I doubt the methods worked very well, but shame is the ultimate enemy of a teenager, and they made me feel better.

I was also a bit of a closet nerd.  I would stay up all night and read science fiction books by flashlight.  My dad would take me to used book sales and we would spend hours buying books on random topics.  I say closet because I never really owned being a nerd.  I didn't hang out with the nerd crowd.  I didn't (usually) play Magic cards or the other things that characterized being a nerd in the late 90s/early 2000s.  It wasn't that I didn't find these things fun.  I just figured that I was somehow cooler by not doing them, and being cool was important to me for some reason.

College was a breath of fresh air.  I used my newfound independence to make some great decisions, like working to pay my tuition.  I got a lot better at making friends.  But I felt unfulfilled.  I switched my major from pre-med to biology to american history.  I partied a lot and got terrible grades.  I was fascinated with computers and technology, but never made use of my time to explore them or befriend people who thought like me.  I played an online game a lot, but didn't tell anyone about it; shame was evidently still my enemy.

After college, I went out into the world and did a lot of things that seemed interesting initially, but ultimately didn't fulfill me.  After a couple of jobs, I became a US diplomat and ended up in South America.  I still felt directionless, and kept wasn't really invested in my work (I went out almost every night).  This was very fun at the time, but I kept feeling the urge to create and make an impact.  While I was in Guyana (the small country I was posted to), I started to learn Ruby and made a couple of simple websites.

I showed the people around me, who were not programmers, and I received mostly shrugs in response.  But the programming bug had taken hold of me, and I quit my job to go back to the United States.  I had no clear objective other than the need to make things.  In the years since then, I have been fortunate enough to make a lot of things, ranging from stock price prediction algorithms to websites that help students peer grade each other's work.

I have learned a lot, and it has been an incredible experience.  But a structured one.  From the beginning of my programming journey, most of the things I have made have been made in some reasonably defined context.  I started programming by trying to predict the stock market, which has well-defined rules and outcomes.  I then started doing machine learning competitions on [Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com), which gives you sets of data, and asks you to predict an outcome.  There is a clear structure, and a way to measure the winners.

When I worked at [edX](http://www.edx.org), there was a similar structure.  We made tools that supported our core mission and aims, and as in any organization, there was no real single point of decision making on features.  It wasn't until I left edX that I realized that I should have owned being a nerd earlier in my life.

Let me explain.  A reasonable number of people who are fascinated with computers as children go on to become programmers, designers, and other tech-associated titles.  A far smaller percentage of people who aren't fascinated by computers as children work in the tech space now.  I wish I had some hard data on this, but if you will kindly refrain from busting out your pitchfork for now, it will let me lay out the rest of my argument.

Humans are social creatures.  Inevitably, when we make something or have an idea, we want to tell someone (preferably as many someones as possible; this is what social media is all about, right?).  Software is no different.  We want people to interact with our software, to probe its strengths and weaknesses, and pass judgement on it.  Usually, this process makes software much better.  Through this process, we create structure.  Oh, you think I should add Google Sign in to my educational website?  Suddenly, you go from blindly making things to making something that fits a clearly defined need.

There are many avenues on the internet dedicated to doing this.  For example, [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/startups) and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) are two of the many places where smart people share things that they have made and ideas they have.  The internet is kind of like having your own megaphone.  But everyone else also has their own megaphone.  The ideas that spread are the ones that can quickly convince other people of their merits.  It's easy to throw something out there and get some attention on it for a while.  It's much harder to get sustained interest and meaningful feedback, especially for something that is unrefined.

The best way to get feedback on things is from people you have actual relationships with.  As a bonus, you also get to see the cool things they make and talk to them about their interesting ideas.  A well defined structure makes this less necessary.  After all, working for a company gives you built in feedback mechanisms (your product manager/peers/etc), and built in customers.  You don't often ask your friends what the next feature they think you should add to product X at your company is.  You also don't really need feedback if you are making small tools for personal use or education.

It's only in that sweet spot between small tools and reasonably sized company that peer feedback becomes important.  Some people would call this space "startups," but I think it also includes side projects that you would like to get adoption and a whole range of other things.  But before you get to that space, you almost never think about how important friends who code are.

But once you get into it, you are suddenly swimming blind.  You know what you want, and maybe you even know what you will pay for.  But you have no idea if a lot of people (or even some people) want what you want.  You don't know if adding feature X will get more people using your product.  A lot of times, you don't have enough experience in an area to know if an idea will work or not.  This is when you start to need friends who code.  Trying to share software ideas with friends who don't code is really
