At the start of 2011, I didn't know how to program.  By the end, I was analyzing data and using machine learning to make predictions like no one's business.  In the subsequent years, I learned how to build web sites and mobile apps.  Learning a new programming skill feels amazing. You suddenly have the ability to build things you never could have imagined.  Thousands (or if you are lucky, millions) of people may derive value from your creations.  Basically, there is so much dopamine rushing around your brain that you feel tempted to run around in circles telling everyone how great you are.

But, in the days and months after, your behavior starts to change.  It's so subtle at first that it's hard to detect.  But as you keep learning, the feeling becomes unmistakable.  You go from reading about the newest anonymous chat app for cats and thinking "Wow, that must have been hard to make!  My cat would really like that!" to "I could make that app in two days!  Why is techcrunch covering it?  Nobody will ever use that!"  Overuse of exclamation marks aside, you've been hit by the cynicism bug.

Knowing how things are made is a double-edged sword when it comes time to judge them.  On one hand, we can fully deconstruct what is in front of us and figure out what makes it tick.  On the other hand, because we have already spent time learning the hard lessons involved in making it, we discount the time it took to learn those lessons.  There are two main signs of this kind of cynicism -- when you start judging things based on their perceived utility to you rather than on their actual utility to their target audience, and when you assume that anyone going about making such a thing would have your prior knowledge.

This can be insidious, because it inevitably leads us to question why they even bothered.  When you think like this, the world starts to look like a giant stage, full of actors trying to convince each other that they created something amazing.  This is obviously a bad way to view things, but maybe not just in the way you expect.  It causes you to show fewer things in public, for fear that what you have made isn't good enough or polished enough (after all, you don't want to just be an actor, you want to actually have something good).  In the long run, this can lead to less motivation and effort.  It also makes other people view you less favorably.  If every time I talk about cool new technologies with you, you tell me how lame they are, I'm probably not going to talk to you about them for very long.

A logical cynic (which most are) would interject at this point, and ask a question along the lines of "but if their products really are bad, and really would only take me a day to make, then why shouldn't I be cynical about it?"
